# Quadifier
A tool designed to visualize and test an algorithm for 'quadifying' pixel objects.
Given a connected set of pixels (tiles of a grid) the algorithm will try to optimize the 2D mesh by summing up
multiple pixels in one larger rectangle, using as few rectanlges as possible to. Basically trying to find a better topology.
